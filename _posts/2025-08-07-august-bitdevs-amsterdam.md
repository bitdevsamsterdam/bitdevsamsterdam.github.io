It's time for another BitDevs! A big thanks to [Bitonic](https://www.bitonic.nl) for sponsoring us with the meeting space. Drinks will be provided, so please ensure you have some dinner beforehand or bring it along to the seminar.

Doors open at 6:30PM and we will try to start promptly at 7PM. As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follows:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
1. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
